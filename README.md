First, I imported the walmart dataset from kaggle into jupyter notbook. Then I took a large-scale look at the data to see if there is missing data or if there are outliers in the dataset.
Then, after examining the correlation between the data, the CPI and unemployed variables caught my eye. After the correlation matrix, I did some statistical calculations and decided that there might be a relationship between these two variables.
With the regression analysis I did, I aimed to predict the change in the consumer price index of the relevant walmart market in the region depending on unemployment.
